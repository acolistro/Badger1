BADGER APP - IMPLEMENTATION HISTORY

Date: January 13, 2025

1. Initial Setup Phase
- Created project with MVVM architecture
- Set up Room Database and DAOs
- Implemented Firebase Authentication
- Added Hilt dependency injection

2. Data Layer Implementation
- Created entities and models
- Implemented repositories
- Added type converters for Room
- Set up RemoteDataSource for Firebase

3. UI Implementation Started
- Created fragments for main features
- Implemented data binding
- Added Material Design components
- Started navigation setup

4. Current Implementation Status
a) Completed Components:
- Database structure
- Authentication system
- Repository pattern
- Basic MVVM architecture

b) In Progress:
- Material theme implementation
- Navigation setup
- Fragment implementations
- Firebase integration

5. Issues Encountered and Solutions:
a) Material Theme Issue:
- Problem: MaterialButton inflation error
- Cause: Incorrect theme inheritance
- Solution: Updated to Theme.MaterialComponents

b) Navigation Issues:
- Problem: Fragment navigation setup
- Solution: Implementing proper navigation with Safe Args

6. Next Implementation Steps:
a) Short Term:
- Complete theme implementation
- Finish navigation setup
- Implement remaining fragments
- Add list sharing functionality

b) Medium Term:
- Add real-time updates
- Implement offline support
- Complete user profile features

7. Technical Decisions Made:
- Using Flow instead of LiveData for reactive programming
- Implementing Repository pattern for data management
- Using Data Binding for UI updates
- Implementing MVVM with clean architecture principles

8. Component Details:

Login Flow:
- Email/password authentication
- Firebase Auth integration
- User profile creation
- Local data persistence

List Management:
- CRUD operations
